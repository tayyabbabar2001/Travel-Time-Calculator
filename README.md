# Travel-Time-Calculator
a C++ program that aids travelers in estimating the total time it will take to reach their destination. By providing information on the distance, average speed, number of traffic signals, and number of speed breakers along the route, users can calculate the expected travel time, factoring in signal stops and speed breaker delays.  

**Features:**
Distance and Speed Input: The program prompts the user to input the total distance to their destination and the average speed at which they will be traveling.

Traffic Signal and Speed Breaker Inputs: Users are asked to enter the number of traffic signals and speed breakers they expect to encounter during their journey.

Calculation: The calculator efficiently computes the travel time based on the provided distance and speed. Additionally, it estimates the time added due to stops at traffic signals and delays caused by speed breakers.

**How to Use:**

Run the program.
Enter the total distance to your destination when prompted by the console.
Input the average speed at which you plan to travel.
Enter the number of traffic signals and speed breakers along your route.
The program will process the input and display the total time taken to reach the destination, including any time added due to traffic signals and speed breakers.
**Note:**

The Travel Time Calculator assumes the user will provide valid positive numerical values for distance, average speed, number of traffic signals, and number of speed breakers.
The calculator estimates 2 minutes for each traffic signal stop and 1 minute for each speed breaker delay.
